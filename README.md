MLB game prediction and betting application, from daily web scrapes to pre-game inference and bet notification

## Disclaimer

This was my very first python project, and for that matter my very first serious programming undertaking. You'll find much of the code is hacky, duplciate, and looks like it was exported out of a Jupyter notebook (because it was). I'm slowly trying to refactor this into a reasonable and extendible python package, as well as adding newly trained models to the ensemble predictor. Please don't judge me on the quality of this code, unless you like it, then judge away!

## Package Setup

Run "python setup.py develop" to install package

** Code is not functional - major code refactoring currently in progress
